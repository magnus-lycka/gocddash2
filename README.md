# gocddash2
Status dashboard for Go.CD Continuous Delivery Servers

## Purpose

This is intended as a replacement for gocddash. There are three reasons for that:

 * I want a dashboard which can aggregate information from more than one GoCD server.
 * The original gocddash grew from a reasonably modest start into a slow, entangled monolith, and i want to get back to light and modular.
 * I want something which is trivial to run as a docker container. I see no reason to support other ways of running it.
